## Gemini Added Memories
- The user wants me to update the GEMINI.md file after each interaction to keep the knowledge base up-to-date.
- The user wants me to ask about creating a git commit message after I finish building something.
- There is only one GEMINI.md file, located at .gemini/GEMINI.md.
- don't git commit anything by yourself, unless stated otherwise. the default setting need to be, you generating a commit msg and return that prompt
- The user prefers commit messages in the conventional commit format (`<type>: <subject>`), with a body that lists the changes.
