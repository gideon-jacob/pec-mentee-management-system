### 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces

The application will feature a clean, modern, and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). Key UI elements will include:

- A centralized dashboard for each user role providing a quick overview of relevant information (e.g., list of mentees for a mentor, departmental stats for an HOD).
- User-friendly forms for data entry with clear labels, placeholders, and real-time validation to minimize errors.
- Interactive and responsive tables for displaying lists of students and academic data, with robust sorting, filtering, and search capabilities.
- A dedicated and comprehensive profile page for each student, presenting all information in a well-organized and easily digestible manner, separated by general and semester-specific data.
- **4.1.1 Responsive Table Behavior (Card-Based Transformation)**
    - To ensure optimal usability on all devices, particularly mobile, all data tables within the application will adopt a responsive transformation.
    - **On Large Screens (Desktops/Tablets):** Tables will render in their standard columnar format.
    - **On Small Screens (Mobile):** Each row of the table will transform into a `Card` component. Inside each card, the data from the columns will be displayed vertically, with clear `Labels` for each data point (e.g., "Register Number:", "Program:"). Action buttons or menus (like "View Profile" or "Edit") will be given prominence, often rendered as a full-width button at the bottom of the card for easy tapping. This approach avoids horizontal scrolling and presents information in a digestible, mobile-friendly format.

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces

As a web-based application, the system will not interface directly with any specific hardware. It will be accessible through any standard device (desktop, laptop, tablet, smartphone) with a modern web browser.

### 4.3 Software Interfaces

- **Frontend-Backend Communication:** The React.js frontend will communicate with the Spring Boot backend via a RESTful API. All data exchange will happen through this API.
- **Database:** The backend application will interface with a PostgreSQL database hosted on Supabase using the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API.
- **Future Integrations:** The system is designed with the potential for future API-based integration with the college's Student Information System (SIS) for data synchronization (e.g., syncing student data from existing systems like NetKampus).

### 4.4 Communications Interfaces

- All communication between the client (web browser) and the servers (AWS S3/CloudFront and EC2) will be encrypted using HTTPS (HTTP over SSL/TLS) to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

### 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance

- **Response Time:** All pages and API responses should load within 3 seconds under normal network conditions.
- **Concurrency:** The system must be able to handle concurrent access from at least 100 users without significant degradation in performance.
- **Data Processing:** Reports and data exports should be generated within 10 seconds for typical data sets.

### 5.2 Security

- **Authentication & Authorization:** The system must enforce strict role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users can only access data and perform actions permitted by their role.
- **Data Encryption:** All data transmission must be encrypted using SSL/TLS. Passwords must be securely hashed and salted before being stored in the database.
- **Vulnerability Protection:** The application must be protected against common web vulnerabilities, including but not limited to SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

### 5.3 Reliability

- **Availability:** The application should have a target uptime of 99.5%, excluding scheduled maintenance.
- **Data Integrity:** The system must ensure that data is not corrupted or lost. Transactional integrity must be maintained for all database operations.
- **Backup and Recovery:** Regular, automated backups of the database must be performed to prevent data loss, with a clear recovery plan in place.

### 5.4 Usability

- **Learnability:** The user interface should be intuitive and easy to learn for users with basic computer skills, requiring minimal training.
- **Consistency:** A consistent design language, layout, and navigation should be used throughout the application to avoid user confusion.
- **Error Handling:** The system shall provide clear, user-friendly error messages and guidance on how to resolve issues.

### 5.5 Scalability

- **Architectural Design:** The application architecture must be designed to handle a gradual increase in the number of students, mentors, and the volume of data stored over several academic years.
    - **Stateless Backend:** The Spring Boot backend services shall be stateless, allowing for horizontal scaling by running multiple instances behind a load balancer.
    - **Database Scaling:** The PostgreSQL database must be configured with efficient indexing strategies. Connection pooling will be used to manage database connections effectively.
    - **Asynchronous Processing:** Long-running tasks, such as generating large reports, should be handled asynchronously to avoid blocking user requests.

### 5.6 Maintainability

- **Code Quality and Principles:** The source code must be well-documented, clean, and follow industry best practices and design principles to facilitate future updates and maintenance.
    - **Backend (Spring Boot):** The code should adhere to SOLID principles and a clear separation of concerns (e.g., Controller-Service-Repository layers).
    - **Frontend (React):** The code should follow a component-based architecture, with a clear state management strategy to handle application data.
    - **Modularity:** The application should be designed in a modular fashion, allowing individual features to be updated or replaced with minimal impact on other parts of the system.
    - **CI/CD:** A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline should be established for automated testing and deployment, ensuring code quality and release stability.

### 5.7 Offline Support

- **Data Caching:** The PWA must cache essential application data and previously viewed student profiles on the user's device to allow for offline viewing.
- **Data Synchronization:** Data entered or modified offline must be queued locally and synced reliably with the server once a network connection is available. The user should be notified of the sync status.

### 5.8 Installability

- The application must be a PWA and should prompt users to install it on their home screen on supported devices (desktop and mobile) for easy, app-like access.

### 6. UI Description

Please refer to the `ui_descriptions.md` document for a detailed, page-by-page breakdown of the user interface for each role.
